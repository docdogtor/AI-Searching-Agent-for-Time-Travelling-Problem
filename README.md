# AI-Searching-Agent-for-Time-Travelling-Problem
Developed an AI agent to search for the optimal and shortest path and navigate through a complex time-travelling configuration (a set of grid worlds with bi-directional time-travel-channels). The problem was solved using three algorithms: breadth-first search (BFS), uniform-cost search (UCS), and A* search with an admissible heuristic.
